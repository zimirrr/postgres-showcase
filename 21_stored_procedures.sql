/*

Before v11 of Postgres it was relatively unimportant if stored routines where called functions or procedures (there was
no inherent difference opposite to Oracle for example), but as of v11 "real stored procedures" were added, with own
syntax and special capabilities that shortly could be described as allowing COMMIT-s from within a loop (just like
possible in Oracle). New "CALL" syntax must be used for executing such "procedures", for old "functions" SELECT can
still be used.
